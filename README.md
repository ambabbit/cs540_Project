# Adam Babbit CS540 Project - Update Land Use Code
Found in this repo, there is a script for updating your parcel table directly as this is a rather light update to run. There is also access to a predefined table with the parid and updated column ready to be joined on the parid with your parcel table.
## Note
In order to add the premade table data into the pgAdmin, right click on the database, select restore. Navigate to the file location. Then restore from that file and join off of it.
